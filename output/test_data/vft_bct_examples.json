    "question": "A state built a casino and issued bonds to finance its construction. On five occasions, there were episodes of violence in various casinos in the state. The state police attributed the violence to greed and fear at the casinos. To prevent such violence, the state legislature passes a statute prohibiting all gambling at privately owned casinos in the state. Is this law likely to be held constitutional if most casinos in the state were owned by those from out-of-state?",
    "choices": [
      "Yes, because the act was expressly authorized by the state legislature.",
      "Yes, but only if the local interest in safety outweighs the burden of interstate commerce.",
      "No, because out-of-state casinos are part of interstate commerce.",
      "No, because the statute violates the due process rights of the owners of the casinos."
